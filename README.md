# predict_self-harm-suicide_ideation_dynamic_indices-
## Test
Suicide is a leading global cause of death, yet predicting suicide risk is difficult due to rapid changes in self-harm urges and suicidal thoughts. Using EMA, passive sensing, and person-specific dynamic indices (e.g., variability and instability), this study tests whether person-specific models improve short-term prediction.
